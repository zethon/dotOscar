.NET Library for the AOL Instant Messenger OSCAR Protocol

## Note

This code was originally written in ~2006. Recently I found myself in need of a .NET library to connect to AOL Instant Messenger and was unable to find anything written recently. I found this code on a old drive and to my surprise it still works! I may eventually turn this into a full-fledged project with a sample client and unit tests, but for now I'm simply publishing the class for anyone who might be in need of something similar.
